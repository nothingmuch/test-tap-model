=head1 NAME

Test::TAP::Model - Accessible (queryable, serializable object) result collector
for L<Test::Harness::Straps> runs.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Test::TAP::Model

	my $t = Test::TAP::Model->new($structure);

	my @tests = $t->test_files; # objects interface

	YAML::Dump($t->structure); # the same thing we made it with

	$t->run_tests(qw{ t/foo.t t/bar.t }); # has a side effect of creating struct

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a subclass of L<Test::Harness::Straps> (although in an ideal
world it would really use delegation).

It uses callbacks in the straps object to construct a deep structure, with all
the data known about a test run accessible within.

It's purpose is to ease the processing of test data, for the purpose of
generating reports, or something like that.

The niche it fills is creating a way to access test run data, both from a
serialized and a real source, and to ease the querying of this data.

=head1 YEAH YEAH, WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR?

Well, you can use it to send test results, and process them into pretty
reports. See L<Test::TAP::HTMLMatrix>.

=head1 TWO INTERFACES

There are two ways to access the data in L<Test::TAP::Model>. The complex one,
which creates objects, revolves around the simpler one, which for Q&D purposes
is exposed and encouraged too.

Inside the object there is a well defined deep structure, accessed as

	$t->structure;

This is the simple method. It is a hash, containing some fields, and basically
organizes the test results, with all the fun fun data exposed.

The second interface is documented below in L</METHODS>, and lets you create
pretty little objects from this structure, which might or might not be more
convenient for your purposes.

When it's ready, that is.

=head1 HASH STRUCTURE

I hope this illustrates how the structure looks.

	$structure = {
		test_files => $test_files,

		start_time => # when the run started
		end_time   => # ... and ended
	};

	$test_files = [
		$test_file,
		...
	];

	$test_file = {
		file => "t/filename.t",
		results => \%results;
		events => $events,

		# optional
		pre_diag => # diagnosis emitted before any test
	};

	%results = $strap->analyze_foo(); 

	$events = [
		{
			type => "test",
			num    => # the serial number of the test
			ok     => # a boolean
			result => # a string useful for display
			todo   => # a boolean
			line   => # the output line

			# pugs auxillery stuff, from the <pos:> comment
			pos    => # the place in the test file the case is in

			time   => # the time this event happenned
		},
		{
			type => "bailout",
			reason => "blah blah blah",
		}
		...,
	];

That's basically it.

=head1 OBJECT INTERFACE

The object interface is structured around three objects:

=over 4

=item L<Test::TAP::Model>

A whole run

=item L<Test::TAP::Model::File>

A test script

=item L<Test::TAP::Model::Subtest>

A single case in a test script

=back

Each of these is discussed in it's respectful manpage. Here's the whole run:

=head1 METHODS

=head2 The said OOP interface

=over 4

=item test_files

Returns a list of L<Test::TAP::Model::File> objects.

=item ok

=item passing

=item passed

=item nok

=item failed

=item failing

Whether all the suite was OK, or opposite.

=item total_ok

=item total_passed

=item total_nok

=item total_failed

=item total_percentage

=item total_ratio

=item total_seen

=item total_skipped

=item total_todo

=item total_unexpectedly_succeeded

These methods are all rather self explanatory and either provide aggregate
results based on the contained test files.

=item ratio

An alias to total_ratio.

=back

=head2 Misc methods

=over 4

=item new

Creates an empty harness.

=item new_with_struct $struct

Adopts a structure. This is how you take a thawed structure and query it.

=item new_with_tests @tests

Takes a list of tests and immediately runs them.

=item get_tests

A method invoked by C<run> to get a list of tests to run.

This is a stub, and you should subclass it if you care.

=item run

This method runs the list of tests returned by C<get_tests>.

=item run_tests @tests

Runs these tests. Just loops, and calls analyze file, with an eval { } around
it to catch bail out.

=item run_test $test

Actually this is the part which does eval and calls C<start_file> and
C<analyze_file>

=item start_file

This tells L<Test::TAP::Model> that we are about to analyze a new file.

This will eventually be moved into an overridden version of analyze, I think.

Consider it's existence a bug.

=item log_event

This logs a new event with time stamp in the event log for the current test.

=item latest_event

Returns the hash ref to the last event, or a new one if there isn't a last
event yet.

=item file_class

This method returns the class to call new on, when generating file objects in
C<test_files>.

=item structure

This method returns the hash reference you can save, browse, or use to create
new objects with the same date.

=item log_time

This is an accessor. If it's value is set to true, any events logged will have
a time stamp added.

=back

=head1 SERIALIZING

You can use any serializer you like (L<YAML>, L<Storable>, etc), to freeze C<<
$obj->structure >>, and then you can thaw it back, and pass the thawed
structure to C<new_with_struct>.

You can then access the object interface normally.

This behavior is guaranteed to remain consistent, at least between similar
versions of this module. This is there to simplify smoke reports.

=head1 ISA Test::Harness::Straps

L<Test::TAP::Model> is a L<Test::Harness::Straps> subclass. It knows to run
tests on it's own. See the C<run> methods and it's friends.

However, you should see how C<run_test> gets things done beforehand. It's a bit
of a hack because I'm not quite sure if L<Test::Harness::Straps> has the proper
events to encapsulate this cleanly (Gaal took care of the handlers way before I
got into the picture), and I'm too lazy to check it out.
